# Week 6 Thinking Cap
### 1. What are your thoughts on "thick mapping in the digital humanities," and how does it differ from "mapping?"
Thick mapping is completely different than normal mapping. Mapping can only provide so much information, just a visual representation of a place. Mapping is stagnant, once the map is created, there is no more intake of information. Thick mapping; however,
shows more than just a place. There are layers of information that when combined, tell a narrative. The map is able to convey a complete message about the people, plac, history, etc. Thick maps are able to change and develop in order to add more information and multiple voices.  
This ability to show the depth of a subject renders thick mapping a complex and effective way to convey information.
