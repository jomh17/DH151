<h1> About Me :)</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is <b>Josephine</b>, and I am <i>22</i>. I am originally from Northern Kentucky, which is essentially just the suburbs for Cincinnati, OH. I have a cavapoo named Scarlett! You can find out more about cavapoos here, <a href="https://www.perfectdogbreeds.com/cavapoo/" target= "_blank"> Cavapoos </a> The first time I was in California was when I was deciding what college to go to! This is my fourth year as a student at UCLA and I am going to graduate as a <i>materials science engineer</i>. I enjoy my major but am missing the personal connection. I chose <b>digital humanities</b> as my <i>technical breadth</i> so that I can regain that aspect and learn how to effectively communicate. This course should be incredibly beneficial to me! Learning more about coding and ways to get information across is incredibly interesting as well as being an amazing communication tool. I also enjoy exploring different topics related to special equity that we will be learning about in this course. I hope to learn more about humanities issues and after compiling the data, analyze the changes that need to occur. Looking forward to a great quarter! </p>
