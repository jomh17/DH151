Site's Agenda: Carto aims to provide users with a visual representation of spacial data in order for further analysis to be possible. The user only has a data file with geolographical information but they have no way to view it visually and interpolate it onto a map. This is where Carto comes in so they have a better understanding of what the data actually means. 
This website is honestly pretty amazing. There are a multitude of functions that allow for a user friendly experience. The map can be as simple or as detailed as the user desires. Each data point can be customized to include extra information, pictures, etc. You can add pop-ups to each point and also add widgets
How does mapping work: You overlay a dataset over a map. The data can come in multiple forms so you are able to extrapolate from many different sources including a google drive, csv file, dropbox file, excel, arcgis, etc. Once you choose the data you would like to import,the data populates onto the map. Multiple data sets can be layered on the same map. Open street maps sources the geological data and provides the maps used in carto.  
Changes: Honestly the only thing that should be changed is to add some tutorials about creating different maps and using functions within them. It is hard to know about all the amazing features when you are first starting.
